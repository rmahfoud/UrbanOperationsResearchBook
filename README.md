# Summary
This project is an effort to convert the online version of the first edition of [Urban Operations Research](http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/) book (Prentice-Hall Â© 1981) into a more readable ebook format (EPUB). This book is one of my favorites since I read parts of it during my graduate school. Unfortunately, it's out of print and used copies are sold at exorbitant prices. I thought it should be a nice exercise to scrape the online book and convert it to an EPUB that I can enjoy again.

# Running
To produce the EPUB book, invoke the main script: <code>bin/run.py</code>. The epub book will appear in the current director as <tt>UrbanOperationsResearch.epub</tt> for you to enjoy on your favorite e-reader.

# Copyrights
These scripts are for personal enjoyment only. Please respect the copyrights of the original book and do not distribute the ebook that's produced by these scripts.

# Dependencies:
