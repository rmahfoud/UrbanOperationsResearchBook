# Summary

This project is an effort to convert the online version of the first edition of [Urban Operations Research](http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/) book (Prentice-Hall Â© 1981) into a more readable ebook format (EPUB). This book is one of my favorites since I read parts of it during my graduate school. Unfortunately, it's out of print and used copies are sold at exorbitant prices. I thought it should be a nice exercise to scrape the online book and convert it to an EPUB that I can enjoy again.

# Running

To produce the EPUB book, run the following: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmahfoud/UrbanOperationsResearchBook.git
cd UrbanOperationsResearchBook
bin/run.py
```

The EPUB book will appear in <tt>/tmp/uor/uor.epub</tt> for you to enjoy on your favorite e-reader.

The settings (including file paths) are defined in <tt>UrbanOperationsResearchBook/settings.py</tt>.

# Validation

The generated EPUB was validated using the online [EPUB Validator (beta)](http://validator.idpf.org/application/validate) tool.

The resulting EPUB was visually inspected with:

- [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) on the desktop (Ubuntu and Windows).
- [Moon+ Reader Pro](http://www.moondownload.com/) on an Android phone.

Please report any issues in the EPUB on [github](https://github.com/rmahfoud/UrbanOperationsResearchBook/issues).

# Quality

The following are issues I found with the book as it's currently present online:

- The URL of [Prof Odoni's home page](http://web.mit.edu/orc/www/faculty/odoni.html) leads nowhere. I linked to his [new profile page](https://cee.mit.edu/odoni)
- The URL of [Prof Larson's home page](http://www-caes.mit.edu/people/larson.html) leads nowhere. I linked to his [new profile page](https://esd.mit.edu/Faculty_Pages/larson/larson.htm)
- [Section 4.8.1: Why Are M/G/m, G/G/1, and G/G/m Difficult?](http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/chapter4/4.8.1.html) is missing
- [Table 6-12](http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/chapter6/images6/Table6-12.gif) in [section 6.5.7](http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/chapter6/6.5.7.html) is missing 
- Its HTML in general is not of modern quality and does not translate directly to XHTML

While doing the conversion I ignored many of the warnings/errors due to non-canonical XHTML because it turns out most good readers do not require canonical XHTML and will work and render pages just fine. I ended up doing the bare-minimum required translations. Some things you might encounter (and might want to submit fixes for) if you use a reader that doesn't entirely like the current XHTML:

- The use of the ```<center>``` tag which is disallowed
- The use of the ```<font>``` tag which is disallowed
- The use of inline styles (e.g. ```<table cellpadding="5">```, or ```<p align="center">```) instead of CSS

# Dependencies:

On Ubuntu/Debian, run the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev build-essential \
     g++-4.4 libboost-all-dev libsparsehash-dev \
     git-core perl ipython
```

or equivalent on non-Debian systems. 

Then install the following python dependencies:

```bash
sudo pip install cryptography
sudo pip install scrapy
```

# TODO:

1. Successfully convert to MOBI format in calibre to use on Kindle.
1. Add images to manifest in OPF file
1. 1.2: messed up blockquote
1. Remove use of ```<font>``` tag
1. Remove use of ```<center>``` tag
1. Remove inline style and replace with CSS
